# Deep Learning Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects I have worked on to practice building and training neural network models for different applications. 

## Contents

The repository contains the following projects:

### Image Classification

- [Cat vs Dog Image Classifier](https://github.com/Siddharthj2002/Neural-Networks-Practice/tree/master/Dog%20vs%20Cat%20Image%20Classification): A convolutional neural network to classify images of cats and dogs. Implements custom model and transfer learning with VGG16.

- [MobileNet Image Classification](https://github.com/Siddharthj2002/Neural-Networks-Practice/tree/master/Basic%20Image%20Classification%20with%20MobileNet): Uses a compact MobileNet model to classify images of common objects.

- [Sign Language Digit Recognition](https://github.com/Siddharthj2002/Neural-Networks-Practice/tree/master/Sign%20Language%20Digit%20Image%20Classification): Classifies images of hand signs representing digits 0-9 using a CNN.

### Neural Style Transfer

- [Artistic Style Transfer](https://github.com/Siddharthj2002/Neural-Networks-Practice/tree/master/Neural%20Style%20Transfer): Blends the style of one image with the content of another using a pre-trained deep learning model.

### Medical Data Analysis

- [Medical Trial Analysis](https://github.com/Siddharthj2002/Neural-Networks-Practice/tree/master/Medical%20Trial%20ANN): Analyzes simulated medical trial data using neural networks to predict side effects based on patient age.

## Aim

The goal of these projects is to get hands-on practice with deep learning concepts like:

- Building and training convolutional neural networks
- Using transfer learning 
- Processing image data and creating data pipelines
- Evaluating model performance

Completing these fundamental projects helped me gain experience with different network architectures and strategies for tackling image-related tasks.

## Getting Started

The projects are self-contained in their own directories with a dedicated README explaining the problem, data, model architecture and training process.

Jupyter notebooks are included documenting the model implementation and training code. Pre-trained models and sample images are provided to easily test out the models.
