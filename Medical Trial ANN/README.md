# Medical Trial Analysis Notebook

This Jupyter notebook provides an analysis of data from a hypothetical medical trial testing a new drug on patients of different ages.

## Contents

1. Loading and preprocessing trial data
2. Exploratory analysis of age groups and side effect rates
3. Building a neural network model to predict side effects based on age
4. Evaluating model performance on a test set
5. Saving and loading trained models

## Data

The notebook generates synthetic data simulating a trial with 2100 patients aged 13-100. Around 95% of elderly patients and 5% of younger patients experienced side effects.

## Requirements

The analysis uses Python and the following key packages:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- TensorFlow

## Usage

To run the analysis:

1. Install the required packages
2. Clone this repository
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially

The notebook trains a neural network model to predict side effects from age, evaluates results, and provides examples of saving/loading models.
